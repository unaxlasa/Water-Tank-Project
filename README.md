### Project objectives
The objective of this project is to control a water tank using ATMega328p microcontroller and C lenguage . In order to do so, we have to use some sensor to measure the level of the water, the rain and the pump of the scape pump.

### Controllers and modules

Arduino Uno
LCD keypad shield
4x4 matrix keypad
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
I2C BME280 humidity, temperature, and barometric sensor
SG-90 micro servo
